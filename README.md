## About The Data Wrangling Workshop
Data is the new oil, but itâ€™s often in a crude form. To perform anything meaningful, such as data modeling, data visualization, or predictive analysis, you first need to wrangle with and refine data. [The Data Wrangling Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Workshop-actionable-insights/dp/1839215003/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1611065162&sr=1-1&utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801078955&utm_term=Data%20Wrangling&utm_content=The%20Data%20Wrangling%20Workshop) equips you with the knowledge you need to get up and running with data wrangling in no time.
